# 1.Outlier Detection

Outlier detection is a crucial step in data analysis that involves identifying and handling data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset. Outliers are observations that lie far away from the majority of the data points and can distort statistical analyses, leading to biased results and inaccurate interpretations. Detecting outliers is essential for ensuring the integrity and reliability of data analysis.

Various methods can be used to detect outliers, including statistical techniques and visualization methods. Statistical methods often rely on measures of central tendency and dispersion, such as the mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range (IQR). These methods define thresholds or ranges beyond which data points are considered outliers and are subsequently removed or treated.

Visualization techniques, such as box plots, scatter plots, and histograms, provide graphical representations of the data that facilitate the identification of outliers. Box plots, for example, display the distribution of the data and highlight potential outliers as points beyond the whiskers of the plot. Scatter plots allow visual inspection of relationships between variables, making it easier to identify data points that do not conform to the expected patterns.

It's essential to consider the context of the data and the specific objectives of the analysis when choosing an outlier detection method. While some methods are suitable for normally distributed data, others are more robust to skewed distributions or outliers of varying magnitudes. Additionally, outlier detection should be conducted iteratively, as removing outliers can impact subsequent analyses and may require reassessment of the data.

Overall, outlier detection is a critical aspect of data preprocessing that helps ensure the accuracy and validity of analytical results. By identifying and appropriately handling outliers, analysts can improve the quality of their analyses and make more informed decisions based on reliable data.


### Mean Function:

Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the 'price_per_sqft' column.
Define a range around the mean (commonly ±3 standard deviations).
Keep only the data points within this range.

### Percentile Method (IQR):

Calculate the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3).
Compute the interquartile range (IQR) as Q3 - Q1.
Define lower bound as Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and upper bound as Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.
Keep only the data points within this range.

### IQR (Interquartile Range) Method:

Same steps as the Percentile Method but without calculating quartiles again.
Use the already calculated Q1 and Q3.

### Normal Distribution (Z-score):

Calculate the z-score for each data point using the formula: 
Z-score
=(X−mean)/standard deviation

Define a threshold (commonly 3).
Keep only the data points with absolute z-scores less than the threshold.

### Z-score Method:

Same steps as Normal Distribution but without the absolute value.



### Mean Function:
This method involves calculating the mean and standard deviation of the data. Outliers are then defined as data points that lie outside a certain range around the mean, typically a specified number of standard deviations. For example, outliers can be identified as data points lying more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean. These outliers are considered to be atypical and are removed from the dataset.

### Percentile Method (IQR):
The percentile method, also known as the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, involves calculating quartiles (Q1 and Q3) and the Interquartile Range (IQR = Q3 - Q1). Outliers are then defined as data points that fall below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR. This method is based on the spread of the middle 50% of the data and is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean method.

### IQR (Interquartile Range) Method:
Similar to the percentile method, the IQR method also relies on quartiles and the Interquartile Range. Outliers are defined as data points lying beyond a certain range from the first and third quartiles. However, unlike the percentile method, the IQR method does not involve specific percentiles and is often used to identify outliers in skewed distributions.

### Normal Distribution:
In this method, data points are evaluated based on their deviation from the mean in terms of standard deviations. Z-scores are calculated for each data point, representing how many standard deviations it is away from the mean. Typically, data points with a Z-score greater than a predefined threshold (e.g., 3) are considered outliers and are removed from the dataset. This method assumes that the data follows a normal distribution.

### Z-score Method:
The Z-score method is essentially the same as the normal distribution method. It calculates the Z-scores for each data point and compares them to a predefined threshold to identify outliers. However, unlike the normal distribution method, the Z-score method is more general and can be applied to any distribution, not just normal distributions.

Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the distribution of the data and the specific requirements of the analysis. It's essential to understand the characteristics of the dataset and select the most appropriate method for outlier detection and removal.



# 2. Hypothesis testing

Hypothesis testing is a fundamental statistical method used to draw conclusions about population parameters based on sample data. It involves formulating competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (Ha), and testing them using sample evidence. The null hypothesis represents the default assumption, stating that there is no significant difference or effect, while the alternative hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis and suggests that there is a significant difference or effect. Through hypothesis testing, researchers aim to assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis and determine whether the observed results are statistically significant. This process involves selecting an appropriate test statistic, collecting sample data, calculating the test statistic, and comparing it to critical values or regions based on a chosen significance level (α). By following a structured approach, hypothesis testing provides a rigorous framework for making decisions and drawing conclusions in various fields, including science, medicine, economics, and social sciences. It enables researchers to assess the validity of claims, evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and contribute to evidence-based decision-making.



### The general steps involved in hypothesis testing:
#### 1.State the Hypotheses:

##### Null Hypothesis (H0): The null hypothesis represents the default assumption.
##### Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The alternative hypothesis represents what the researcher is trying to find evidence for.


#### 2.Choose a Significance Level (α):

The significance level, denoted by α, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Commonly used values for α are 0.05 (5%) or 0.01 (1%).
#### 3.Select the Appropriate Test Statistic:

This depends on factors such as the type of data (e.g., categorical, continuous), the sample size, and the hypothesis being tested.
#### 4.Collect Data and Calculate the Test Statistic:

Collect a sample from the population of interest and calculate the appropriate test statistic using the sample data.
#### 5.Determine the Critical Region or Critical Value:

Based on the chosen significance level (α) and the null hypothesis, determine the critical region of the test statistic or critical value(s) from the sampling distribution.
#### 6.Make a Decision:

Compare the calculated test statistic to the critical value(s) or check if it falls within the critical region. If the test statistic falls within the critical region, reject the null hypothesis. If it does not, fail to reject the null hypothesis.
#### 7.Interpret the Results:

Based on the decision made in step 6, interpret the results in the context of the research question and draw conclusions about the population parameter.
#### 8.Conclusion:

State the conclusion, including whether the null hypothesis was rejected or failed to be rejected, and what this implies about the population parameter.
It's important to note that hypothesis testing does not prove that the null hypothesis is true or false with absolute certainty. Instead, it provides evidence to support or refute the null hypothesis based on the observed data and the chosen significance level. Additionally, hypothesis testing is just one part of the statistical inference process, which also includes estimation and prediction.



# 3.Data Preprocessing

In this data preprocessing project, our primary goal is to develop a comprehensive system that effectively handles common challenges encountered in datasets, such as missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise. By meticulously preprocessing the data, we aim to optimize its quality, reliability, and suitability for machine learning applications.

### 1. Data Exploration:
In the initial phase of our data preprocessing project, we embark on a thorough exploration of the dataset. This involves scrutinizing its structure and content to gain a comprehensive understanding. We meticulously examine each feature, identifying unique values and determining their lengths. Additionally, we delve into statistical analyses to uncover insights into the distribution of data. Furthermore, we consider renaming columns for enhanced clarity and consistency, ensuring that the dataset remains coherent and interpretable.

### 2. Data Cleaning:
Following the exploration phase, we transition to data cleaning, a crucial step in preparing our dataset for analysis. Here, we address various imperfections and anomalies present in the data. We strategically handle missing values by employing appropriate techniques such as removal, replacement with statistical measures like mean, median, or mode, or employing more sophisticated imputation methods. Additionally, we eliminate duplicate rows to mitigate redundancy and identify and mitigate outliers that may distort our analyses. Furthermore, we rectify specific anomalies like replacing zero values in the age column with NaN to bolster data integrity.

### 3. Data Analysis:
With the data now cleansed, we proceed to derive actionable insights through data analysis. This phase involves filtering the dataset based on predefined criteria, such as age > 40 and salary < 5000, to focus our analysis on pertinent subsets. Additionally, we leverage visualization techniques to elucidate relationships between variables, employing charts or plots to elucidate patterns and trends. Furthermore, we quantify the number of individuals hailing from each location and visually represent these counts to glean insights into geographical distributions effectively.

### 4. Data Encoding:
In the subsequent step of data encoding, we transform categorical variables into numerical representations amenable to machine learning algorithms. This necessitates the utilization of techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding to ensure that categorical data is appropriately encoded for subsequent analysis. Through this process, we strive to maintain the integrity of the data while facilitating its compatibility with machine learning models.

### 5. Feature Scaling:
Finally, we undertake feature scaling to standardize or normalize numerical features, a critical aspect of model preparation. Leveraging techniques like StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler, we scale features to a consistent range, thereby enhancing the performance of machine learning models. By normalizing or standardizing features, we alleviate issues stemming from differing scales and magnitudes, ensuring optimal model performance and interpretability.

### Conclusion:
By systematically addressing each component of data preprocessing, we aim to transform the raw dataset into a clean, structured, and standardized form ready for analysis and modeling. Effective data preprocessing is essential for building accurate and reliable machine learning models, and this project endeavors to achieve that goal by implementing best practices and techniques in data preprocessing. Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the importance of data preprocessing in ensuring the success of machine learning endeavors.

## 2.Classification Algorithms:

#### Introduction
In the realm of machine learning, classification algorithms are fundamental to predicting the categorical labels of new instances based on past data. These algorithms are crucial across diverse fields, such as finance, healthcare, and customer segmentation. Each classification model has unique characteristics and performance metrics that make them suitable for specific types of data and problems. In this report, we evaluate the performance of five different classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes. The evaluation is based on their accuracy, specificity, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

#### General Steps 
###### 1.Data Preparation: 
Before training, the data is preprocessed which includes handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing data, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

###### 2.Model Training: 
Each classifier is trained on the dataset. Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes rely on statistical approaches, while Decision Tree and Random Forest make decisions based on the structure of the data. KNN classifies based on the proximity to neighboring data points.


###### 3.Performance Evaluation: The models are evaluated using a set of metrics:

1.Accuracy:
Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
2.Specificity:
Assesses the model's ability to correctly predict the negative class.
3.AUC:
Represents the model's ability to discriminate between the classes.
###### 4.Hyperparameter 
Tuning: Parameters of each model are adjusted to optimize performance.

###### 5.Validation:
The final step involves validating the model on a separate dataset to ensure that it generalizes well to new data.


#### Conclusion
The comparative analysis of these five classifiers reveals that while some models like the Decision Tree and Random Forest provide high accuracy, models such as KNN and Naive Bayes excel in terms of AUC, indicating a superior ability to distinguish between classes. The choice of classifier largely depends on the specific requirements of the task, including the nature of the data and the criticality of false positives and false negatives. For tasks where the cost of misclassification is high, models with higher AUC and specificity should be prioritized. Each classifier has its strengths and weaknesses, and often a combination or ensemble of multiple models provides the best results. Future steps could include experimenting with ensemble techniques or exploring more complex algorithms tailored to the specific characteristics of the dataset.
